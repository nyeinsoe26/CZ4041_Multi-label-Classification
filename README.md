# CZ4041 group assignment
## Project overview
In this project, we have opted to implement the multi-label classification task. We will be using "emotions", "yeast" and "bookmark" datasets to assess the performance of the respective classifiers. The datasets are obtained from [https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/multilabel.php].  
There are 3 python files submitted:
1. EDA.py
2. CZ4041_Assignment1_BaseImplementations.py
2. neuralnet.py


## Tools and envrionment
